Version 0.2   (2025-01-30)

   1) Bug fix in predict.gammi() for non-Gaussian response
	* Error occurred when requesting type = "response" predictions
	* Problem was caused by passing data.frame to family$invlink()
	* Updated code converts data.frame to matrix before passing

   2) Bug fix in gammi.default() for binomial responses with factor "y"
	* Error occurred when "random" was NULL and "y" was a factor
	* Problem was caused by passing "y" (factor) to C function
	* Updated code converts "y" to 0/1 before passing to C code

   3) Bug fix to support back compatibility with older versions of R
	* Error occurred when sparse matrix was passed to crossprod()
	* In older/newer versions, crossprod() was from base/Matrix package
	* Updated code explicitly uses Matrix::crossprod() to avoid ambiguity

   4) Various internal improvements
	* spline.basis() improvements for unordered factors
	* Better NA handling for gammi (formula and default methods)
	* Improvements to plotting functions
