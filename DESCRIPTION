Description: An interface for fitting generalized additive models (GAMs) and generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) using the 'lme4' package as the computational engine, as described in Helwig (2024) <doi:10.3390/stats7010003>. Supports default and formula methods for model specification, additive and tensor product splines for capturing nonlinear effects, and automatic determination of spline type based on the class of each predictor. Includes an S3 plot method for visualizing the (nonlinear) model terms, an S3 predict method for forming predictions from a fit model, and an S3 summary method for conducting significance testing using the Bayesian interpretation of a smoothing spline.
